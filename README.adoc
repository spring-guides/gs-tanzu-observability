This guide walks you through your first Spring Boot project with Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.

== What You Will build

You will create a simple web application and configure it to send metrics to a freemium cluster.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

Initialize your project using the Spring Initializer:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Select your favorite build system and language. This guide assumes you've selected Java.
. Click **Add dependencies** and select **Spring Web** and then **Wavefront**.
. Click **Generate**. You download a ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that includes Tanzu Observability.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete the steps above from your IDE.

== Out-of-the-Box Observability

Follow these steps to start the project and to automatically send several auto-configured metrics to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.

. Before you start the service, configure the project so that you can identify the metrics sent by the application and service.
Open the `application.properties` file and add the following:
+
[indent=0]
----
	wavefront.application.name=demo
	wavefront.application.service=getting-started
----
+
NOTE: The properties above configure the integration to send metrics to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront using the `demo` application and the `getting-started` service.
An application can consist of an arbitrary number of services.

. Run the application from your IDE by invoking the `main` method of `DemoApplication`.
You see the following:
+
[indent=0]
----
	INFO 16295 --- [           main] o.s.b.a.e.web.EndpointLinksResolver      : Exposing 2 endpoint(s) beneath base path '/actuator'
	INFO 16295 --- [           main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path ''
	INFO 16295 --- [           main] hello.DemoApplication         : Started DemoApplication in 1.207 seconds (JVM running for 1.727)

	A Wavefront account has been provisioned successfully and the API token has been saved to disk.

	To share this account, make sure the following is added to your configuration:

		management.metrics.export.wavefront.api-token=ee1f454b-abcd-efgh-1234-bb449f6a25ed
		management.metrics.export.wavefront.uri=https://wavefront.surf

	Connect to your Wavefront dashboard using this one-time use link:
	https://wavefront.surf/us/AtoKen
----

**What Happened?**

* Without any extra information, an account on a Freemium cluster was automatically provisioned for you.
* An API token was created for you.
* To let you access your dashboard on the Freemium cluster, a one-time use link was logged when the application started. The link starts with `https://wavefront.surf`.
Copy this link into your favorite browser and explore the out-of-the-box Spring Boot dashboard:

[NOTE]
====
It takes a minute for the data to show up.
When you can see the data in Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, make sure that the **Application** and **Service** names in the filters match what you configured in the `application.properties` file.

== Create a Simple Controller

Next, you can create a simple controller to see how HTTP traffic is automatically instrumented.
The following listing shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/DemoController.java[]
----
====

. Restart the application and trigger `http://localhost:8080` from your browser multiple times.
. You'll notice an extra HTTP section on the dashboard.
This feature is called conditional dashboards and lets you display sections according to a filter.
+

. Optionally, access `http://localhost:8080/does-not-exist` to trigger a client-side 404 error.

== Accessing Your Dashboard Using /actuator/wavefront

You can use an actuator endpoint to access your dashboard without having to look at the logs and get the link each time you start your application.
To enable this feature, you need to expose the `wavefront` endpoint.

. Open the `application.properties` file and add the following:
+
[indent=0]
----
	management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,wavefront
----
+
NOTE: `health` and `info` are exposed out-of-the-box.
. Restart the application, and navigate to  http://localhost:8080/actuator/wavefront to access the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront dashboard.

== Summary

Congratulations!
You just developed a web application that sends metrics to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.
