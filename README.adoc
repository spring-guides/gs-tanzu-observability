This guide walks you through your first Spring Boot project with Aria Operations for Applications.

== What You Will Build

You will create a simple web application and configure it to send metrics to an Operations for Applications account.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&groupId=com.example&artifactId=gh-tanzu-observability&packageName=hello&dependencies=web,wavefront[this pre-initialized project] and click **Generate** to download a ZIP file.
This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

If you want to initialize the project manually, follow the steps given below:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Select your favorite build system and language. This guide assumes you've selected Java and Maven.
. Click **Add dependencies** and select **Spring Web** and then **Wavefront**.
. Click **Generate**. You download a ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that includes Operations for Applications.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete the steps above from your IDE.

== Out-of-the-Box Observability

Follow these steps to start the project and to automatically send several auto-configured metrics to Operations for Applications.

. Add the https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-spring-boot[Wavefront for Spring Boot 3 starter] to the Maven dependencies.
Open the `pom.xml` and add the following to the `<dependencies>` block:
+
[indent=0]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.wavefront</groupId>
  <artifactId>wavefront-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
----
+

. Before you start the service, configure the project so that you can identify the metrics sent by the application and service.
Open the `application.properties` file and add the following:
+
[indent=0]
----
	management.wavefront.application.name=demo
	management.wavefront.application.service-name=getting-started
----
+
NOTE: The properties above configure the integration to send metrics to Operations for Applications using the `demo` application and the `getting-started` service.
An application can consist of an arbitrary number of microservices.
+

. To send data to the Operations for Applications account, specify the `uri` and `api-token` properties as follows:
+
[indent=0]
----
    management.wavefront.api-token=$API_Token
    management.wavefront.uri=$wavefront_instance
----
+
[indent=1]
	* `$API_Token` is a valid https://docs.wavefront.com/users_account_managing.html#generate-an-api-token[API token for your Operations for Applications instance].
	* `$wavefront_instance` is the name of your Operations for Applications instance, for example, `https://example.wavefront.com`.


. Run the application from your IDE by invoking the `main` method of `DemoApplication`.
You see the following:
+
[indent=0]
----
    INFO 58371 --- [           main] o.s.b.a.e.web.EndpointLinksResolver      : Exposing 1 endpoint(s) beneath base path '/actuator'
    INFO 58371 --- [           main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path ''
    INFO 58371 --- [           main] hello.DemoApplication                    : Started DemoApplication in 1.705 seconds (process running for 2.038)
----

**Examine Your Data**

To examine the data:

* Go to your server instance, click Dashboards > All Dashboards and enter Spring Boot Inventory.
* Select Contains: Spring Boot Inventory, and click the Spring Boot Inventory result in the table.
You are taken to the Wavefront Spring Boot Inventory dashboard where you can examine the data sent by your application. This dashboard provides real-time visibility into your Spring Boot application landscape. The dashboard has several sections that include the following charts:

[NOTE]
====
It takes a minute for the data to show up.
When you can see the data in Operations for Applications, make sure that the **Application** and **Service** names in the filters match what you configured in the `application.properties` file.

== Create a Simple Controller

Next, you can create a simple controller to see how HTTP traffic is automatically instrumented.
The following listing shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/DemoController.java[]
----
====

. Restart the application and trigger `http://localhost:8080` from your browser multiple times.
. You'll notice an extra HTTP section on the dashboard.
This feature is called conditional dashboards and lets you display sections according to a filter.

. Optionally, access `http://localhost:8080/does-not-exist` to trigger a client-side 404 error.


== Summary

Congratulations!
You just developed a web application that sends metrics to Operations for Applications.
