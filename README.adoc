This guide walks you through your first Spring Boot project with Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.

== What You Will build

You will create a simple web application and configure it to send metrics to a freemium cluster.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&groupId=com.example&artifactId=gh-tanzu-observability&packageName=hello&dependencies=web,wavefront[this pre-initialized project] and click **Generate** to download a ZIP file.
This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

If you want to initialize the project manually, follow the steps given below:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Select your favorite build system and language. This guide assumes you've selected Java.
. Click **Add dependencies** and select **Spring Web** and then **Wavefront**.
. Click **Generate**. You download a ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that includes Tanzu Observability.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete the steps above from your IDE.

== Out-of-the-Box Observability

Follow these steps to start the project and to automatically send several auto-configured metrics to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.

. Before you start the service, configure the project so that you can identify the metrics sent by the application and service.
Open the `application.properties` file and add the following:
+
[indent=0]
----
	management.wavefront.application.name=demo
	management.wavefront.application.service-name=getting-started
----
+
NOTE: The properties above configure the integration to send metrics to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront using the `demo` application and the `getting-started` service.
An application can consist of an arbitrary number of microservices.

. Run the application from your IDE by invoking the `main` method of `DemoApplication`.
You see the following:
+
[indent=0]
----
    INFO 58371 --- [           main] o.s.b.a.e.web.EndpointLinksResolver      : Exposing 1 endpoint(s) beneath base path '/actuator'
    INFO 58371 --- [           main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path ''
    INFO 58371 --- [           main] hello.DemoApplication                    : Started DemoApplication in 1.705 seconds (process running for 2.038)

    A Wavefront account has been provisioned successfully and the API token has been saved to disk.

    To share this account, make sure the following is added to your configuration:

        management.wavefront.api-token=ee1f454b-abcd-efgh-1234-bb449f6a25ed
        management.wavefront.uri=https://wavefront.surf

    Connect to your Wavefront dashboard using this one-time use link:
    https://wavefront.surf/us/AtoKen
----

**What Happened?**

* Without any extra information, an account on a Freemium cluster was automatically provisioned for you.
* An API token was created for you.
* To let you access your dashboard on the Freemium cluster, a one-time use link was logged when the application started. The link starts with `https://wavefront.surf`.
Copy this link into your favorite browser and explore the out-of-the-box Spring Boot dashboard:

[NOTE]
====
It takes a minute for the data to show up.
When you can see the data in Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, make sure that the **Application** and **Service** names in the filters match what you configured in the `application.properties` file.

== Create a Simple Controller

Next, you can create a simple controller to see how HTTP traffic is automatically instrumented.
The following listing shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/DemoController.java[]
----
====

. Restart the application and trigger `http://localhost:8080` from your browser multiple times.
. You'll notice an extra HTTP section on the dashboard.
This feature is called conditional dashboards and lets you display sections according to a filter.

. Optionally, access `http://localhost:8080/does-not-exist` to trigger a client-side 404 error.


== Summary

Congratulations!
You just developed a web application that sends metrics to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.
